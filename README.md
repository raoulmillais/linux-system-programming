# Linux Systems Programming

Following along with the examples from the [Linux Systems Programming](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-System-Programming-Talking-Directly/dp/1449339530/)
book by [Robert Love](https://www.rlove.org/).

Not all of the examples are verbatim, and I have annotated where I encountered
specific issues on my system. I am running an up-to-date Arch Linux system.

Current versions:
```
gcc (GCC) 4.8.2 20140206 (prerelease)
Linux 3.13.6-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 GNU/Linux
glibc 2.19-3
```

I combined several snippets to improve my own understanding and added makefiles
to aid with building and to get to grips with those aspects of system
programming.
